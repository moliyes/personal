300.0       # Temperature (float type, in units of K)
1.0         # Relaxation time (float type, in units of s), Set 1.0 if you don't know the exact relaxation time
0.0         # Desired gap value in scissor correction (float type, in units of V), Zero means make no correction, available only non-spin-polarization calculation
