general:
  ENMAX = 400
  SYSTEM = CO adsorption on Ni(111)
  ISMEAR = -5
  ALGO = Fast
    
LDOS:
  LORBIT = 11
    
workfunction:
  IDIPOL = 3
  LDIPOL = .TRUE.
  LVHAR = .TRUE.
#  LVTOT = .TRUE.


# For the calculation of the DOS we use a tetrahedron method with Bl√∂chl corrections (ISMEAR=-5).
# By setting LVHAR=.TRUE. the Hartree part of the local potential is written to the file LOCPOT.
# By setting LVTOT=.TRUE. the total local potential is written tot the file LOCPOT.
# By setting IDIPOL=3 dipole corrections in the direction of the third lattice vector are enabled.
# We have active dipole corrections to potential (=dipole layer).
