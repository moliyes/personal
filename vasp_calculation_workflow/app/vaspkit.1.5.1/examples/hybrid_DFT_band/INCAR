Global Parameters
  ISTART =  1            (Read existing wavefunction; if there)
  # ICHARG =  11         (Non-self-consistent: GGA/LDA band structures)
  LREAL  = Auto          (Projection operators: automatic)
  ENCUT  =  300          (Cut-off energy for plane wave basis set, in eV) 
  PREC   =  Normal     (Precision level)  
  LWAVE  = .TRUE.        (Write WAVECAR or not)
  LCHARG = .TRUE.        (Write CHGCAR or not) 
  ADDGRID= .TRUE.        (Increase grid; helps GGA convergence) 
  SIGMA  =  0.05
 
Static Calculation
  ISMEAR =  0            (tetrahedron method for DOS) 
  LORBIT =  11           (PAW radii for projected DOS)
  NEDOS  =  2001         (DOSCAR points) 
  NELM   =  60           (Max electronic SCF steps)
  EDIFF  =  1E-08        (SCF energy convergence; in eV)
 
HSE06 Calculation
  LHFCALC= T            (Activate HF)
  AEXX   =  0.25        (25% HF exact exchange, adjusted this value to reproduce experimental band gap)
  HFSCREEN= 0.2         (Switch to screened exchange; e.g. HSE06)
  ALGO   =  ALL         (Electronic Minimisation Algorithm; ALGO=58)      
  TIME   =  0.4         (Timestep for IALGO5X)
  PRECFOCK= N           (HF FFT grid)
