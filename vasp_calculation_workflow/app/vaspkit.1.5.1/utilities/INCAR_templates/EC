  ISMEAR =  0

  LEPSILON = .TRUE.      (Determined by density functional perturbation theory)
  ! LCALCEPS = .TRUE.    (OR Determined by self-consistent response of the system to a finite electric field)
  LPEAD    = .TRUE.      (Determined derivative of the cell-periodic part of the orbitals using finite differences)
