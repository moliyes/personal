Frequence Calculations
  NSW    =  1            (number of ionic steps. Make it odd.)
  ISMEAR =  0            (gaussian smearing method )
  SIGMA  =  0.05         (please check the width of the smearing)
  IBRION =  5            (frequence calculation)
  POTIM  =  0.02         (displacement step)
  NFREE  =  2            (displacement freedom)
