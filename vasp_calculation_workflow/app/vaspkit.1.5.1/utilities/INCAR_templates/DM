The dimer method
  NSW    =  500          (number of ionic steps.)
  ISMEAR =  0            (gaussian smearing method )
  SIGMA  =  0.05         (please check the width of the smearing)
  IBRION =  3            (do MD with a zero time step)
  POTIM  =  0            (Zero time step so that VASP does not move the ions)
  ICHAIN =  2            (Use the dimer method required for the latest code)
  DdR    =  0.005        (The dimer separation (twice the distance between images)
  DRotMax  =  1          (Maximum number of rotation steps per translation step)
  DFNMin =  0.01         (Magnitude of the rotational force below which the dimer is not rotated)
  DFNMax =  1.0          (Magnitude of the rotational force below which dimer rotation stops)
  IOPT   =  2            (CG = Conjugate Gradient)
